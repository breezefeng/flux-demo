This demo helps you learn [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). It is inspired by Andrew Ray's great article [Flux For Stupid People](http://blog.andrewray.me/flux-for-stupid-people/).

## What is Flux?

Flux, invented by Facebook, is an architecture pattern for building client-side web applications.

It is similar to MVC architecture, but Flux's concept is [much clearer](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/facebook-mvc-flux) than MVC's, and easier to learn.
